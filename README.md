===========

This repository contains the KiCad files for the V2 Mirobot PCB. THere are three boards in total:

 * __Main__ - this is the main Mirobot PCB
 * __LineFollow__ - this is the add-on board for line following
 * __Programmer__ - this fits into the Arduino socket and allows the ESP WiFi module to be reprogframmed
 
Additionally, in the lib folder, there is both the schematic library and the footprint library used across all three projects.
